# About

This front-end project was build using vanilla CSS and JavaScript, and it's intended to be an alternative to the usual browser homepages. By using it, the users can add and visit sites by typing the corresponding keys.

## Usage

- To visit a site, the user enters the key associated with the site.
- If a site has a search option, the user can type a single quote after the siteâ€™s key, then the query
- If the user wants to use Google search, he can type the asterisk, followed by the query
- If the user wants to use DuckDuckGo search, he can type the minus symbol, followed by the query.

## Examples
- Entering `y` will redirect to youtube.com
- Entering `y'lions` will search `lions` on YouTube
- Entering `*lions` will search `lions` on Google
- Entering `-lions` will search `lions` on DuckDuckGo

Using the local storage, users can add or remove sites; they can also check how is the weather in various cities, with data being fetched from the [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/)
